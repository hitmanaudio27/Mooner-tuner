   flutter doctor
   # Should show ‚úì for Xcode and CocoaPods
   ```

## üì± Building the iOS App

### Step 1: Navigate to Project Directory
```bash
cd /path/to/mooner_tuner
```

### Step 2: Install iOS Dependencies
```bash
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

### Step 3: Open in Xcode (Optional, for configuration)

- **Deployment Target**: iOS 11.0 or later

### Step 4: Build for Device/Simulator

**For iOS Simulator:**

```

**For Physical Device (Debug):**
```bash
# Connect iPhone via USB, unlock, and trust computer
flutter run -d "Your iPhone Name"
```

**For Release Build (TestFlight/App Store):**
```bash
flutter build ios --release
```

**For Ad-Hoc Distribution (no App Store):**
```bash
flutter build ipa --release
# IPA file will be at: build/ios/ipa/mooner_tuner.ipa
```

## üîß iOS-Specific Configuration

### Microphone Permission (‚úÖ Already Configured)
The app requires microphone access. We've added this to `Info.plist`:
```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Mooner Tuner needs access to your microphone to detect musical pitch and provide real-time tuning feedback.</string>
```

### Supported Orientations
Currently configured for:
- ‚úÖ Portrait (primary)
- ‚úÖ Landscape Left
- ‚úÖ Landscape Right

To lock to portrait only, edit `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:
```xml
<key>UISupportedInterfaceOrientations</key>
<array>
    <string>UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait</string>
</array>
```

### App Display Name

3. Submit for review
4. Wait for approval (typically 1-3 days)
5. Release to public

### Option 3: Ad-Hoc (Direct Install, no App Store)
1. Build IPA: `flutter build ipa --release --export-options-plist=ios/ExportOptions.plist`
2. Register device UDIDs in Apple Developer Portal
3. Create Ad-Hoc provisioning profile
4. Distribute IPA file to users
5. Install via Xcode or TestFlight alternatives

### Option 4: Enterprise Distribution

- ‚úÖ Tree shaking enabled
- ‚úÖ Obfuscation for release builds

### Additional Optimizations
```bash
# Build with additional optimizations
flutter build ios --release \
  --tree-shake-icons \
  --split-debug-info=build/ios/symbols \
  --obfuscate
```

## 📱 What Your Friends Will Experience

### **Desktop (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)**
✅ Works perfectly  
✅ Full microphone access  
✅ Great performance  
✅ All features work  

### **Android Mobile (Chrome)**
✅ Works well  
✅ Microphone access (after permission)  
⚠️ May need to "Add to Home Screen" for best experience  

### **iOS Mobile (Safari)**
⚠️ Works but with limitations:
- Microphone access may be restricted
- Audio processing less powerful than native
- Performance may vary
- Best to use in Safari browser

**Note:** For iOS users, native app would be better, but web version still works!

- **Solution:** Check browser compatibility

### **Issue: App not loading**
- **Solution:** Clear browser cache
- **Solution:** Check if build/web folder is complete
- **Solution:** Verify deployment settings

### **Issue: Slow loading**

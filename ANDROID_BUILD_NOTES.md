# 📱 Android Build Notes - Mooner Tuner

## Current Status

The app is **fully functional as a web application** and ready for deployment to free hosting services (Netlify, Vercel, etc.).

## Android APK/AAB Build Issue

### Problem
The current audio recording packages (`mic_stream` and `record`) have compatibility issues with the latest Flutter SDK (3.35.4) when building for Android:

- `mic_stream 0.7.2` - Has deprecated API usage
- `record 5.1.2` - Has Linux platform implementation issues

### Solution Options

#### Option 1: Use Web App (RECOMMENDED ⭐)
**The easiest and fastest way for your friends to use Mooner Tuner:**

1. Deploy to Netlify/Vercel (takes 2 minutes)
2. Share the URL with friends
3. Works on ALL devices (Android, iOS, desktop)
4. No installation needed
5. Instant updates

**See `QUICK_DEPLOY.md` for step-by-step instructions!**

#### Option 2: Build with Compatible Audio Package
If you need a native Android APK, here are the steps:

**Step 1: Update pubspec.yaml**
Replace the audio package with a more compatible one:

```yaml
dependencies:
  # ... other dependencies ...
  
  # Use flutter_sound instead (more stable)
  flutter_sound: ^9.2.13
  # OR use audio_session with platform channels
```

**Step 2: Update audio_service.dart**
Rewrite the audio capture logic to use the new package.

**Step 3: Clean and rebuild**
```bash
cd /home/user/flutter_app
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release
```

#### Option 3: Use Older Flutter Version
Downgrade to Flutter 3.10.x which has better compatibility with `mic_stream`:

```bash
flutter downgrade 3.10.6
flutter clean
flutter build apk --release
```

#### Option 4: Fork and Fix mic_stream Package
1. Fork `mic_stream` package
2. Update to use new Flutter embedding APIs
3. Use local dependency in `pubspec.yaml`

### App Name Configuration

✅ **App name is properly configured as "Mooner Tuner":**

- ✅ `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - `android:label="Mooner Tuner"`
- ✅ `android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` - `<string name="app_name">Mooner Tuner</string>`
- ✅ `pubspec.yaml` - Updated description
- ✅ `ios/Runner/Info.plist` - `CFBundleDisplayName: Mooner Tuner`

When you build successfully, the app will show as "Mooner Tuner" on users' phones!

### Recommended Path Forward

**For immediate sharing with friends:**
1. ✅ **Deploy as web app** (2 minutes, works on all devices)
2. Share URL like: `https://mooner-tuner.netlify.app`
3. Friends can use it instantly

**For native Android app later:**
1. Research compatible audio capture packages
2. Test with Flutter 3.10.x if needed
3. Build and distribute APK
